  /**
   * Try is a data structure that enable us to turn exception into value
   * This data structure in my opinion is another huge mind-shifting paradigm
   * from the usual exception throwing. Why is that? By turning exception into value,
   * we can make sure that a function is `total` -- for every input given, the function
   * always return a value or output. Exception thrown in a function will make that function
   * not total or loosely translated as `partial`. The benefit of total function is that
   * every function will behave exactly as its signature, and in return it will make our program
   * easier to reason and will be more likely to be correct when the program typecheck (1).
